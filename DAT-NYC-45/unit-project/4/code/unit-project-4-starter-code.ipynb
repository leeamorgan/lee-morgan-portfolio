Using a sample of cross-sectional UCLA admissions data, we would like to explore the association of GRE score, GPA score, and Prestige with admission to UCLA's graduate school. We will test whether applicants will be more likely to be admitted into UCLA's graduate school when they have higher GRE and GPA scores, and when they come from a more prestigious alma mater."

    "During this project we were able to determine the degree of influence that GRE scores, GPA, and the Prestige of the applicant's undergraduate school has on their probability to be admitted into UCLA.  Our results show that all features have significant impact on the probability to be admitted. We were also able to validate our hypothesis that applicants will be more likely to be admitted into UCLA's graduate school when they have higher GRE and GPA scores, and when they come from a more prestigious alma mater. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand the association between GRE scores, GPA, and Prestige to admission, our next goal could be to build a rebust predictive model. Below are some considerations and next steps to achieve this:\n",
    "* We will need to split our data between Train and Test to properly evaluate the predictive power of our model. We can use cross-validation to assess models on the training data, but we will assess the performance of the final model based on the Test data.\n",
    "* We can adjust are Logistic Regression predictor by using L1, or L2 regularization.  We can also adjust the threshold for classifying admission based on the resulting probability to be admitted (e.g. doesn't need to be 0.5).\n",
    "* We can plot learning curves and determine whether we need to obtain more observations of data or new features to improve the predictive power of our model.\n",
    "* Also, in this study it was important to have a intuitive understanding of the model, but going forward we can test other predictors such as Random Forest and potentially try to improve models results by leveraging PCA."
